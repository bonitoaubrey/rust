Variable is a name assigned to a value in the program.

Variables live inside {} code blocks (scopes).
Variables created inside can't leave them unless they are the return value into another larger scope.
You can change a variable in Rust if you make it mutable with mut.
    Otherwise, the compiler will give an error if you try.
