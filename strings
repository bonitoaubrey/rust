String is a struct String

String is a bit more complicated string.
It may be a bit slower, but it has more functionality.
A String is a pointer with data on the heap.
Both &str and String are encoded with UTF-8.
String is easy to grow, shrink, mutate and so on.

A String owns its data, while a &str is a slice.

str: a stack allocated UTF-8 string, which can be borrowed but cannot be moved or mutated.
String: a heap allocated UTF-8 string, which can be borrowed and mutated.
