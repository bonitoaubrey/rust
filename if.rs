if in Rust is a control flow statement that executes a block of code conditionally based on the evaluation of a boolean expression.

The if statement in Rust is implemented as a jump instruction in the compiled machine code.
When the if statement is encountered, the condition is evaluated and the result is stored in a register.
Based on result, the program counter is updated to either execute the code inside the if block or skip it.
You can use else if and else to give you more control.

intended for controlling the flow of a program based on condition, allowing developers to execute different blocks of code depending on the state of the program.
