Floats are primitive types that represent numbers with decimal points.

Rust supports two types of floating-point numbers:
    f32: is a 32-bit floating-point number and has precision of about 7 decimal places.
    f64: is a 64-bit floating-point number and has a precision of about 15 decimal places.
By default, it will choose f64.
Keep in mind that floating-point numbers can have rounding errors due to their binary representatin.
This means that some decimal numbers cannot be represented exactly as floating-point numbers, which can lead to small errors in calculations.

Use f32 when you need to store a large number of floating-point numbers and don't need high precision.
    This can help reduce memory usage.
Use f64 when you need high precision, such as in scientific simulations or financial calculations.
