In Rust, a range is a way to specify a sequence of numbers or values that can be iterated over, allowing you to work with a series of values in a concise and expressive way.

.. creates an exclusive range - 0..3 gives you 0, 1, 2.
..= creates an inclusive range - 0..=3 gives you 0, 1, 2, 3.

Ranges are similar to iterators, but the key difference is that
    range are a way to specify a sequence of values, while
    iterators are a way to iterate over a sequence of values.
