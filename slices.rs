A slice in Rust is a reference to a contigouus sequence of elements in a collection, such as an array or a vector, that allows you to access and manipulate a subset of the elements without taking ownership of the original data.

Slices are implemented as a fat pointer, which is a tuple containing a pointer to the data and the length of the slice.
When you create a slice, Rust performs bounds checking to ensure that the slice is within the bounds of the original data.
This prevents common errors like buffer overflows or out-of-bounds access.
A slice is created by referencing a range of elements in a collection using the & operator and specifying the start and end indices of the range.
The slice is then a reference to the original data, and any changes made to the slice will affect the original data.

Process a subset of data from a large collection
Pass a subset of data to a function without taking ownership of the original data
Implement algorithms that operate on contiguos ranges of data
Improve performance by avoiding unnecessary cloning or allocation of data
Iterate over a portion of a collection
Return a subset of data from a function
