loop is a control flow construct that enable unconditional repetition of a sequence of statement for an indefined number of iteration.

loops help us avoid writing the same code over and over again.
It makes our program shorter, easier to read, and less prone to mistakes.

The keyword loop lets you start a loop that does not stop unless you tell the code when to break.
Rust allows you to give a loop a name, which is helpful when you are within a loop that is inside another loop.
    You can use a ' (called a tick) followed by a colon to give it a name.
    'first_loop: loop {

Loops are similar to while loop, but a loop will keep running forever unless we use the break keyword to stop it.
A while loop will only run as long as a certain condition is true.
With loops, you can tell Rust to repeat something until you tell it to stop.
