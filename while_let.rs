while let is a syntax sugar in Rust that allows you to combine pattern matching with a loop, making code more concise and expressive.

while let is like a while loop for if let.
When the Rust compiler encounters a while let statement, it desugars it into a loop with a match statement inside.
The match statement checks whether the value matches the pattern, and if it does, executes the code inside the loop.
If the pattern doesn't match, the loop exits.
The Rust compiler generates code that checks whether the value matches the pattern, and if it does, executes the corresponding code.

while let is neccesary because it provide a concise way ho handle situations where you need to loop until a value no longer matches a certain pattern.
Without while let, yo would have to write a full loop with a match statement inside, which can be verbose and cluttered.

//In this example, the while let statement checks whether v.pop return Some(x),
//and if it does, prints the value of x.
//The loop cuntinues until v.pop() returns None.

//while let
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
while let Some(x) = v.pop() {
    println!("{}", x);
}

//loop with match
loop {
    match v.pop() {
        Some(x) => println!("{}", x),
        None => break,
    }
}

//while with pattern guard
while v.len() > 0 {
    if let Some(x) = v.pop() {
        println!("{}", x);
    } else {
        break;
    }
}

In summary, while let is a concise and expressive way to handele pattern matching in loops in Rust, and is particularly useful when you need to loop until a value no longer matches a certain pattern.
