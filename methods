Methods in Rust is a function that is associated with a type, allowing you to perform actions on values of that type in a more object-oriented way.

When you define a method on a type, Rust generates a special kind of function called a "closure" that has access to the type's fields and other methods.
When you call a method on a value, Rust creates a new closure that captures the value's fields and passes it to the method's implementation.

Self means the type Self, and self means the variable called self that refers to the object itself.
When you use a methog, Rust will dereference for you until it reaches the original type.
The . in a method is called the dot operator, and it does dereferencing for free.
