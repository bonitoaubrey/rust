Iterator is sort of like a collection type that gives you its items one at a time.
To iterate means to progress over the elements of a collection one by one.

When you want to use an iterator other times, you have to choose what kind:
    .iter() - For an iterator of references
    .iter_mut() - For an iterator of mutable references
    .into_iter() - For an iterator of value (not references)
