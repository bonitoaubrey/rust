In Rust, char is a primitive type.

Characters in Rust are called char.
Every char has a number.
The list of numbers is called Unicode.
The characters used most (called ASCII) are represented by numbers less than 256, and they can fit into a u8.
This means that Rust can safely "cast" a u8 into a char, using as.
char is always one character and uses ' ' (single quotes).
All chars use 4 bytes of memory, since 4 bytes are enough to hold any kind of character.

Represent a single Unicode scalar value, such as letters, digit, or symbol.
