In Rust, char is a primitive type that represents a single Unicode scalar value.

The char type is an alias for the &u8 type, which is a reference to a byte.
Every char has a number.
The list of numbers is called Unicode.
The characters used most (called ASCII) are represented by numbers less than 256, and they can fit into a u8.
    This means that Rust can safely "cast" a u8 into a char, using as.
All chars use 4 bytes of memory, since 4 bytes are enough to hold any kind of character.

Used when we need to work with single characters in a string or data.

We create a char variable and assign it a value, such as 'a', which represents a single character.
char is always one character and uses ' ' (single quotes).

The char represent a single character, while the u8 represents a single byte.
