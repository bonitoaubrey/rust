A for loop is a way to repeat a set of instructions for each item in a list or a range of numbers.

Loop stops after a certain number of times instead of checking to see whether a condition is true.
A for loop lets you tell Rust what to do each time.
for loops use range very often.

For loops help us work with lists of things, like numbers words.
They make it easy to do the same things to each item in the list, without having to write a lot of code.

We use the for keyword to create a for loop.
If you don't need a variable name, use _ (an underscore).
If you give a variable name and don't use it, Rust will tell you.
Rust suggests writing _name instead of _.
