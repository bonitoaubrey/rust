Result is an enumeration type in Rust, which means it can have one of two possible values: Ok(value) or Err(error).

enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
Ok holds a generic type T, and Err holds a generic type E. They can be different types (and usually are) but could be the same.
Result has a value inside of Ok and inside of Err. That is because errors are supposed to contain information that describes what went wrong.
Result<T, E> means you need to think of what you want to return for Ok and what you want to return fo Err.
When a fuction returns a Result, it indicates that the computation may have succeeded (returning a value wrapped in Ok) or failed (returning an error wrapped in Err).

intended for handling errors and successes in a computation, providing a way to explicitly manage and propagate errors through the program.
used as a return type for function that may encounter errors, such as I\O operations, parsing, or computations that may fail.
The Result type is designed to be used with pattern matching, allowing developers to explicitly handle both the success and error cases.


Option holds a Some or None (value or no value).
    Result holds an Ok or Err (okay result or error result).
