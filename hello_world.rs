fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

fn means function.
main() is the function that starts the program.
() means that we didn't pass the function any arguments
    Argument is an input to a function.
    So, that means the function is starting withou any variables that it can use.
After that comes {}, which is called a code block.
    Code block are spaces where code lives.
    It you start a variable inside a code block, it will live untill the end of the block.
    This is its lifetime.
