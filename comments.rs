In Rust, a comment is a way to add notes or explanations to your code that are ignored by the compiler, allowing you to document your code and make it easier to understand.

There're two types of comments in Rust:
1. Line comments.
2. Block comments. They can span multiple lines.
Rust also supports a special type of comment called a doc comment.
A doc comment can be automatically made into documentation for your code.
The compiler ignores comments and does not execute them as code.

Help other people understand your code.
Help you understand your code later.
Explain what a section of code does.
Provide context for complex logic.
Add reminders for future development.
Document functions, modules, and other code elements.

Line comments: These start with // and continue until the end of the line.
Block comments: These start with /* and end with */.
Doc comments start with ///.

So // means comments for inside the code, while /// is for more official information to be shared beyond the code itself.
