A while loop is a loop that continues to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

The while loop checks the condition before executing the code inside the loop.
If the condition is true, it runs the code, and then checks the condition again.
This process repeats until the condition becomes false.

When we need to perform a task repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
They help us write more efficient and concise code by avoiding the need to write the same code multiple times.

for loops iterate over a sequence (like an array or a vector) while
    while loops continue to execute as long as a condition is true.
