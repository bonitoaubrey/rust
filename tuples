Tuples in Rust is collection of values that can contain a mix of data type and can be stored together in a single unit.

When a tuple is created, Rust infers the type of its elements based on the values assigned to them.
When you don't return anything in a function, you return an empty typle.
In Rust empty tuple is called the unit type.

You can use a tuple to create multiple variables at the same time.
When we need to return multiple values from a function.
When we need to store a small collection of values together.

Tuples are created using parentheses () and values are separated by commas.
To access elements of a tuple, we use the dot notation and the index of the element.

Tuples are similar to struct, but unlike structs, tuples do not have named fields.
While structs are defined with struct keyword and have named fields, tuple are created using parentheses and have indexed fields.
Structs are more suitable when we need to store larger collections of values with meanningful names.
Tuples are more suitable when we need to store small collection of values with a simple index-based access.
