Closures are quick functions that don't need a name (anonymou function).
Sometimes they are called lambdas in other langauges.

One thing that makes closures special is that they can take variables from their environment that are outside the closure, even if you only write ||.

It's easy to notice where closures a because they use || instead of ().

For longer closures, you need to add a code block.
