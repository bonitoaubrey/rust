Ownership is a system that manages the lifetime of values and ensures that each value has a single owner responsible for deallocating its memory.

In Rust, every value has an owner that is responsible for deallocating its memory when it is no longer needed.
When a value is created, it is assigned an owner, which can be a variable, a function, or a data structure.
The owner is responsible for ensuring that the value is properly cheaned up when it goes out of scope.
Ownership is based on the following rules:
    Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner.
    There can only be one owner at a time.
    When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
When you pass a value to a function, the ownership is moved to the function.
When a function returns a value, the ownership is moved back to the caller.

When creating and managing values, such as variables, data structures, and objects.
When passing values to function and returning values from functions.
When working with smart pointers.
When implementing data structure and algorithms that require manual memory management.

Create a value and assign it to a variable.
The variable becomes the owner of the value.
When the variable goes out of scope, the value is dropped.
You can transfer ownership of a value to another variable using the assignment operator.

Borrowing allows you to access a value without taking ownership of it.
Ownership gives you full control over the value.
