The range operator in Rust is a concise way to create an iterator over a sequence of numbers.

.. creates an exclusive range - 0..3 gives you 0, 1, 2.
..= creates an inclusive range - 0..=3 gives you 0, 1, 2, 3.
When you use the range operator, Rust creates an iterator that generates numbers on the fly, starting from the start value and stopping before or at the end value, depending on whether you use .. or ..=.
This iterator uses a simple incrementing or decrementing algorithm to generate the next value in the sequence.

provides a concise and expressive way to create iterators over sequences of numbers, which is a common pattern in programming.
Without the range operator, you would have to write more verbose code to create an iterator, which would make your code harder to read and maintaing.

// In a for loop
for i in 1..6 {
    println!("{}", i);
}
1
2
3
4
5

// In an iterator chain
let numbers: Vec<i32> = (1..6).collect();
println!("{:?}", numbers);
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// In a function argument
fn sum_range(start: i32, end: i32) -> i32 {
    (start..end).sum()
}

range are a way to specify a sequence of values, while
    iterators are a way to iterate over a sequence of values.
The range operator is similar to the Vec construction vec![start..end],
    which creates a vector containing the same sequence of numbers.
    range creates a iterator wheras
    vec! creates a vector.
    This means that the range operator usus less memory and is more efficient when you only need to iterate over the sequence once.

// Creates a vector containing the numbers 1 through 5
let numbers: Vec<i32> = vec![1..6];

// Creates an iterator over the numbers 1 through 5
let numbers: impl Iterator<Item=32> = 1..6;

In the first example, numbers is a vector that contains all the numbers in the sequence, whereas in the second example, numbers is an iterator that generates the numbers on the fly as you iterate over it.
